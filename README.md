Problem 1.
You are going to create a simple program in IntelliJ called "DisplayName". The base package will be the same as the "com.itfactory" course.
➔ I will ask you that in the class created by default "Main" you copy this main method below and run the code.
➔ It is a simple exercise in which you enter a text (in this case a name) from the keyboard that it will display.
➔ It is useful to look in the comments that I put to see the steps and lines of code to make a parallel with what is displayed in the console when you run the program. Have fun. (It is a maximum 10-minute exercise).
➔ It is important to pay attention to the comments and what they are doing. The code is already written, you just have to follow it and execute it.

     public static void main(String[] args)
     {

Problem 2.
Considering the Explanations and code above, adapt the code to also read the person's first name (into a different variable) and display it afterwards.

Example:
Enter your name: Roban
Enter your first name: Marian

The program will display:
The name entered is: Roban Marian

The primitive Class is about this homework:
* Fix the mistakes in this code
* The primitives need to be displayed correctly in console
